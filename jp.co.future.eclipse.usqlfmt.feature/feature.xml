      UroboroSQL Formatter is often used in enterprise systems, For
formatting to a highly maintainable style even for very long
SQL (1 K step or more) It is a plug-in of Eclipse.
In particular, in countries where English is not their mother
tongue, such as Japan, comments may be included in SELECT clauses.
In that case, we will align the vertical position of the AS clause
and the comment, pursuing the viewability which can be said as
artistic anymore, This was developed to realize this automatically.
How to use
Use Ctrl + Shift + L on Windows, Cmd + Shift + L on OS X to format
currently active document.
The following options can be selected by the Preferences dialog.
- Convert reserved words and identifiers to upper case
- Using backslash escape sequences
- Comment syntax type(uroboroSQL or DOMA2)
